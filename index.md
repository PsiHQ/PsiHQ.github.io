Welcome to my page - here, you will find snippets about me, my interests and work and more! Feel free to explore and do contact me if needed - feedback is appreciated!

At present, I am a 4th year student at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata (IACS). I had to mandatorily take physics, maths, chemistry, biology and computer science course for the first 3 semesters at IACS, after which I specialised to physics. This has enabled me to look at the world with a more wholistic attitude and make connections between different ideas even in unrelated contexts.

## Research interests

I aspire to be a theoretical physicist and, as of now, I am mostly into theoretical high energy physics, including both phenomenology and more fundamental aspects. I tend to be more open to different areas as well, however, and have had exposure to a couple different fields in my years at IACS - for example, nonlinear systems, weak measurements and so on. For more information, do visit the [research](/menu1/) page.

On a computational side, I have self learnt Julia as a side interest and hobby - it has now become an integral part of my work, helping me with numerically solving complicated systems and suchlike. Interestingly, I built this webpage with Julia as well! It's super interesting and super fun.
