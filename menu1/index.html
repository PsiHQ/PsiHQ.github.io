My research interests and past exposure are diverse - I have not yet settled on a very niche topic yet. However, I am more inclined towards <em>particle physics</em> and <em>high-energy phenomena</em> - the topic my BS-MS project is broadly based in. </p> <p>At the same time, I have played around a fair bit with other areas - <em>nonlinear dynamics</em>, <em>quantum foundations</em> and <em>gravity</em>. On this page, you will find a broad description of my interests and exposure. </p> <div class=franklin-toc ><ol><li><a href="#nonlinear_systems_parametric_resonances_and_oscillators_spoiler_alert_lots_of_oscillators">Nonlinear systems, parametric resonances and oscillators &#40;spoiler alert: <em>lots</em> of oscillators&#33;&#41;</a><ol><li><a href="#nonlinear_systems">Nonlinear systems</a><li><a href="#parametric_resonances_in_more_complicated_systems">Parametric resonances in more complicated systems</a><li><a href="#bounded_solutions_and_forced_oscillators">Bounded solutions and forced oscillators</a></ol><li><a href="#weak_measurements_and_quantum_theory">Weak measurements and quantum theory</a><li><a href="#axions_dark_matter_and_neutrinos">Axions, dark matter and neutrinos </a><li><a href="#gravitational_formalism">Gravitational formalism</a></ol></div> <h2 id=nonlinear_systems_parametric_resonances_and_oscillators_spoiler_alert_lots_of_oscillators ><a href="#nonlinear_systems_parametric_resonances_and_oscillators_spoiler_alert_lots_of_oscillators" class=header-anchor >Nonlinear systems, parametric resonances and oscillators &#40;spoiler alert: <em>lots</em> of oscillators&#33;&#41;</a></h2> <p>At IACS, I worked with Prof. Jayanta K. Bhattacharjee &#40;who you can see on the homepage&#33;&#41; on nonlinear systems for around a year before he left for IIT, Kanpur, after which I collaborated &#40;and still do&#41; with him online. Broadly, my work with him can be categorised into three separate intervals. </p> <h3 id=nonlinear_systems ><a href="#nonlinear_systems" class=header-anchor >Nonlinear systems</a></h3> <p>Initially, I worked on simple nonlinear systems to look at some interesting aspects of their dynamics. As a fresh undergrad, this familiarised me with basic <em>approximating techniques</em>, <em>differential equations</em>, ideas like <em>linearization</em> and <em>fixed points</em> and so on. </p> <div class=row > <div class=container > <img class = "right" src="/Site/assets/phs.png" width = "250" height = "200"> <p style = "font-size: 15px"> As an example, I worked on a biquadratic potential for some time and looked into its time period which blew up in a certain case. Apart from identifying various possibilities and the divergence, I also looked into the exact dependence of the divergence, visualising the same and so on. </p> <p style = "font-size: 13px"><i> Right: Cool phase space dynamics for the double well described above! </i></p> </div> <p>I also worked on forced oscillators around resonance and learnt to use perturbative techniques to identify their resonant frequencies, applied certain techniques &#40;like Krylov Bogolioubov averaging&#41; to look at their solutions and determined approximate analytical solutions around resonance. </p> <p>A report on the more interesting aspects of this work can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p-KbWKduVuJ_uCbAs4RP9Ig1QYUXwiLs/view?usp&#61;sharing">here</a> &#40;most of the links here redirect to Google drive&#41;.</p> <h3 id=parametric_resonances_in_more_complicated_systems ><a href="#parametric_resonances_in_more_complicated_systems" class=header-anchor >Parametric resonances in more complicated systems</a></h3> <p>In the latter part of 2022, I worked with my classmate, Nilanjan Sasmal, and Prof. Bhattacharjee on an elastic double pendulum - a 6 dimensional complicated system. We identified four resonance conditions using perturbative techniques &#40;two of which, to the best of our knowledge, were not analysed in existing literature&#41;. We looked at the numerical solutions at resonance and briefly investigated the chaotic aspects of the system by computationally getting an idea of the Lyapunov exponent. Unfortunately, due to the system&#39;s complexity, deriving an approximate analytical behavior at resonance proved challenging. </p> <p>I presented our work on the elastic double pendulum in the summer of 2023 at <strong>NODYCON 2023</strong>, held in Rome &#40;unfortunately, I had to present remotely due to some personal constraints&#41;. The abstract that we submitted can be found <a href="https://nodycon.org/2023/papers/192/abstract_submissions/621/view_abstract">here</a> &#40;link to official NODYCON abstract page&#41;.

It has a very well known resonance condition and its behaviour around this point is well known &#40;in the linear order&#41;. Yet, the linear order solution diverges while the actual equation does not - we looked at the system perturbatively and found, surprisingly, that such finite solutions can be explained, even in undamped cases, by an interesting camaraderie between the amplitudes in various orders leading to a destructive interference like effect - just as in the case of light&#33; Furthermore, we found that the amplitude and the time period of this oscillator are drive dependent and follow some interesting power laws - this only happens in a specific interval of drive magnitude though, after which the oscillator tends to become more and more messy - a first order phase transition&#33;</p> <div class=row > <div class=container > <center><img src="/Site/assets/PT37n_img.jpg" width = "250" height = "250"></center> <p style = "font-size: 15px"><i> A comparison of the linear solution (which blows up) and what the original equation describes. </i></p> </div> <p>The preprint on this work can be found on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04125">arXiv:2305.04125</a>.</p> <h2 id=weak_measurements_and_quantum_theory ><a href="#weak_measurements_and_quantum_theory" class=header-anchor >Weak measurements and quantum theory</a></h2> <p>My curiosity in quantum theory was piqued ever since I read Anil Ananthaswamy&#39;s <em>Through Two Doors at Once</em> &#40;on the many interpretations of the quantum theory through the double slit experiment&#41; - J. J. Sakurai&#39;s <em>Modern Quantum Mechanics</em>, in particular, is one of my favourite textbooks. I reached out to Prof. Otto C. W. Kong for insight into the mathematical foundations and he advised me to build up my mathematical repertoire apart from discussing certain interesting issues with me. I later wrote a term paper as part of my curricula on the double slit experiment in classical and quantum contexts, taking inspiration from Richard Feynman&#39;s belief that the whole of quantum theory was hidden in that one singular experiment.</p> <div class=row > <div class=container > <img class = "left" src="/Site/assets/pic6.jpg" width = "200" height = "175"> <p style = "font-size: 15px"><i> <br><br><br> Left: Diffraction pattern from an experiment to measure the wavelength of light that we conducted in the IACS physics lab. <br><br><br> </i> </p> </div> </div> <p>I visited the <em>Chennai Mathematical Institute</em> in the summer of 2023 to work on weak measurements in quantum theory under Prof. H. S. Mani. It was one of the most interesting summers I have spent - looking at basic measurement theory in quantum physics, the groundbreaking Albert-Aharonov-Vaidman paper and its later interpretations. I looked comprehensively into the conceptual idea of a weak measurement and its relation to interference and the quantum nature of matter and explicitly calculated the weak values for certain observables in simple systems - spin-1 particles, oscillator potentials and so on. A report covering certain aspects of this project is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HJdwubqbF81JADzQ5HN3f-iTtnlY1klo/view?usp&#61;sharing">here</a>.</p> <h2 id=axions_dark_matter_and_neutrinos ><a href="#axions_dark_matter_and_neutrinos" class=header-anchor >Axions, dark matter and neutrinos </a></h2> <p>I have had a bit of exposure to particle physics quite early in my undergrad days - I wrote a term paper on the solar neutrino problem in my first year &#40;available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s0cYTZZvwxv6wJApdP2BAUXGybRgws1c/view?usp&#61;sharing">here</a> if interested&#41; and I got very interested in the idea of neutrino oscillations and mass mixing. I later spent the summer of 2022 reading up on some basic ideas related to this - Dirac equations, spinors, neutrino mass models - under the supervision of Prof. Amitava Raychaudhuri at the Raja Bazaar Science College in Kolkata. </p> <p>My 2 years BS-MS project, under Prof. Sourov Roy at IACS, is on axions - super light, weakly interacting particles that are there but maybe not there and which might be a contituent of dark matter - and how they interact with light. For now, my work, which started in August 2023, has involved reading up on existing literature on axion - photon coupling and transitions in the presence of magnetic fields, something I find fascinating. I have looked at recent papers in the field and replicated polarisation based studies - which basically means looking at how the properties of light from distant galaxies and astrophysical objects &#40;like quasars&#41; change when observed at earth and how particles like axions could be responsible for such changes - this has both observational aspects and theoretical and/or computational aspects &#40;the latter of which is what I do&#41;. A report on this, based on the first semester of the project, can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mvn49nclGL092knNy2W4bLjMpHHaebw9/view?usp&#61;sharing">here</a>.</p> <p>For my second semester, I have started looking at a closely related phenomenon - the mixing of gravitons and photons. This follows a similar kind of formalism and right now, I am trying to look at similar polarisation based aspects which might result from such an oscillation. </p> <h2 id=gravitational_formalism ><a href="#gravitational_formalism" class=header-anchor >Gravitational formalism</a></h2> <p>One of the very first exposures to research I had was with Prof. Tapobrata Sarkar at IIT, Kanpur. I &#40;along with some of my classmates&#41; did a brief reading project under him during the latter part of 2021 &#40;online, due to the pandemic&#41; and I learnt a bit about basic mathematical ideas of the relativistic theories - specifically learning about vectors, covectors, geodesics, Lie derivatives and so on. More importantly, Prof. Sarkar introduced us to some interesting packages on Mathematica built for relativists - I played around with them quite a bit, replicating parts of the results from a paper he discussed with us. While it was a brief association, I benefitted from the early exposure to gravity formalism and computational work - it is part of the reason I chose general relativity as an elective in my 4th year since I was very interested in looking more into the formalism I had once attempted to learn a bit on my own.</p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> shihabulhaque.
